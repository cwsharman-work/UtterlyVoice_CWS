      Use this command to type a line for transect data.
      Saying "line 1.1 stop 2.2" gives you:
      1.1 (tab) 2.2 (enter)
      You can try using it multiple times in a row, but it might not work correctly.
      Saying "line 1.1 stop 2.2 stop line 3.3 stop 4.4 stop" should give you:
      1.1 (tab) 2.2 (enter)
      3.3 (tab) 4.4 (enter)
